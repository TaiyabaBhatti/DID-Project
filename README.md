## Inspiration to develop

Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) presents unique challenges, including memory gaps, emotional regulation, and focus issues. We wanted to create a supportive, easy-to-use digital tool that helps both patients and caregivers track emotions, manage triggers, and encourage mindful engagement.


## Core Features

- *User Authentication*: Secure user login and signup powered by Firebase Authentication.
- *Dynamic Content*: Real-time DID resources and updates using Firebase Firestore.
- *Interactive UI*: Responsive and user-friendly design built with React.
- *Awareness Tools*: Resources about DID.
- *Mood Tracker*: Helps users to input their emotions and the reasons for those. Generates some charts on the basis of those.
- *Journaling*: A creative outlet where users can write thoughts, feelings, and reflections. Users can access and review their past notes in real-time whenever needed.
- *Grounding Techniques*: A dedicated platform for the patient in need of grounding to focus on just one thing by giving the patient some exercises that can be beneficial for both their attention and grounding..
- *Alters*: Patient can log their different System Alters and view them.
